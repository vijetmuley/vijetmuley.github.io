I am an upcoming data engineering enthusiast! I am graduating with my Master's degree in Applied Data Science from the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University in May of this year. I love working with databases, restructuring and cleaning data for data governance, warehouses and pipelining. Currently I am interning at the office of Health Promotion at Barnes Center at the Arch.

I started out in the field of data and computers in the year 2013 when I started with my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune in India. My coursework comprised of rigorous coding in C++, databases, theory of computation and OS. My mathematical and statistical inclinations, compounded with my background in computers helped me get into my current program.

At my current work position, I am pulling, restructuring and aggregating from 5 different sources in order to adjudge the completion of community wellness requirements for students on campus. In addition to that, I also analyze the outreach and impact of various activities conducted by the office and evaluate the composition of the target audience.

I have recently been appointed to assist the Director of Health Analytics for a focus group project in order to understand the effect of Pet Therapy on their stress.

My interests are particularly in databases, data logic development, data pipelining and warehousing. I have enjoyed working across different platforms.
