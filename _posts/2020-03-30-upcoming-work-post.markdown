Current Work:
----------
----------

Currently, I am studying 3 courses in my last semester at Syracuse University, namely:
1. IST664: Natural Language Processing
2. IST722: Data Warehousing
3. IST769: Advanced Database Management

I am in process of developing projects for IST664 and IST722.

Chatbot:
----------
----------

The project that I am working on for IST664 is coding and training a chatbot algorithm using the Movie dialogues data set from Cornell. The data set comprises of conversations between movie characters, hence giving a varied range of conversation types. The aim is to train and fit a deep learning model on this data and have a chatbot that can interpret English and converse with the human user with meaningful responses.

Merger Data Warehouse:
----------
----------

For the IST722, the team is focusing on creating a data warehouse for merger of 2 companies. The business process that our warehouse chose to focus on is the market research for the amalgamation of the 2 companies. Currently, we have managed to have high level and detailed level designs for database and recently finished the staging process. Moving forwards, we are focusing on the ETL to the warehouse and then develop some BI dashboards in order to simplify assimilation of data.

In order to  stay tuned to the process, do check my [GitHub][1].
