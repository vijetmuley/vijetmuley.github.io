My Publication Work
----------
----------

During my undergraduate studies in computer engineering, I had a chance to work on an Anomaly Detection in ECG signals project. To couple the work done in the project, the team managed to get a paper published in the International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics. The paper is titled 'Survey and Analysis of ECG Interpretation Techniques'.

The online version of this publication can be found [here][1].
